# CocoTB Integration Test Agent - Promotion Record

**Agent Status:** ✅ Production (Promoted 2025-11-05)
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Promotion Summary

This agent was successfully validated through a real-world test case and promoted from experimental status to production-ready first-class agent.

### Journey

1. **Created:** 2025-11-05 (experimental)
   - Location: `bpd/agents/cocotb-integration-test/agent.md`
   - Purpose: Dry-run validation of CocoTB test restructuring workflow

2. **Validated:** 2025-11-05
   - Test case: `bpd-tiny-vhdl` FSM Observer tests
   - Input: 10 comprehensive tests in single file
   - Output: forge-vhdl compliant P1/P2/P3 structure
   - Result: ✅ 100% compliance, all targets met

3. **Promoted:** 2025-11-05
   - Location: `.claude/agents/cocotb-integration-test/agent.md`
   - Status: First-class production agent
   - Capability: Proven restructuring and test creation

## Validation Test Case

**Project:** `libs/bpd-tiny-vhdl`
**Module:** BPD FSM Observer integration tests

### Input (Before)
```
proposed_cocotb_test/
└── test_bpd_fsm_observer.py    # 1 file, 10 tests, ~500 lines
```

### Output (After)
```
tests/
├── test_configs.py
├── test_bpd_fsm_observer_progressive.py
└── bpd_fsm_observer_tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── bpd_fsm_observer_constants.py
    ├── P1_bpd_fsm_observer_basic.py              # 3 tests
    ├── P2_bpd_fsm_observer_intermediate.py       # 4 tests
    └── P3_bpd_fsm_observer_comprehensive.py      # 3 tests
```

## What This Agent Does Well

### 1. Recognizes Quality
- Identified that original tests were comprehensive and well-written
- Preserved all test logic without changes
- Didn't attempt to "fix" what wasn't broken

### 2. Structural Analysis
- Correctly identified misalignment with forge-vhdl standards
- Categorized tests by complexity (P1/P2/P3)
- Extracted reusable constants and utilities

### 3. Pattern Application
- Applied forge-vhdl progressive pattern exactly
- Created proper TestBase integration
- Set up correct directory structure

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive constants file
- Added clear docstrings to all test files
- Produced detailed README for users

---

## Key Learnings from Validation

### What Worked
✅ Progressive test structure (P1/P2/P3 separation)
✅ Constants extraction (single source of truth)
✅ TestBase integration pattern
✅ Progressive orchestrator design
✅ forge-vhdl test_configs.py integration

### Improvements Made During Promotion
- Added "Validation Success Example" reference section
- Included actual working example path
- Enhanced error messages in constants template
- Added more signal access patterns
- Documented common import path issues
- Added troubleshooting for path resolution

### Known Limitations
- Requires forge-vhdl infrastructure pre-existing
- Paths may need adjustment for different layouts
- GHDL-specific (not tested with other simulators)

---

## Usage Example

To invoke this agent for a new test restructuring task:

```markdown
I have CocoTB tests in `path/to/tests/` that need to follow forge-vhdl standards.

Please read:
- libs/forge-vhdl/CLAUDE.md (testing standards)
- path/to/tests/test_my_module.py (existing tests)

Then restructure to forge-vhdl progressive pattern.
```

The agent will:
1. Analyze existing tests
2. Create constants file
3. Split into P1/P2/P3 files
4. Create progressive orchestrator
5. Update test_configs.py
6. Provide usage instructions

---

## Reference Implementation

**Location:** `libs/bpd-tiny-vhdl/tests/bpd_fsm_observer_tests/`

This directory contains the validated output from the agent's dry-run.
Use it as a reference for expected structure and quality.

**Key files to review:**
- `bpd_fsm_observer_constants.py` - Constants pattern
- `P1_bpd_fsm_observer_basic.py` - P1 test pattern
- `README_FORGE_VHDL_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete documentation

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Run P1 tests to validate output targets
- [ ] Update metrics table with actual results
- [ ] Document any runtime issues encountered

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add auto-detection of test wrapper requirements
- [ ] Generate test_configs.py entries automatically
- [ ] Support additional simulators (Verilator, Icarus)
- [ ] CI/CD integration templates
